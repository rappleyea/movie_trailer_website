Project: Movie Trailer Website  - Chad Rappleyea
================================

Required Libraries and Dependencies
-----------------------------------
This project requires the use of the Python 2.7.10.


How to Run Project
------------------
To run this project, download the python files associated with this website including media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py. Open up Terminal, type out "python," press the spacebar, and then add the file destination for entertainment_center.py. Press enter. 


Extra Credit Description
------------------------
The background color of the body of the website was changed to a dark, grayish-blue (#207373). The color of a tile when the mouse hovers over it was changed from white (#EEE) to a lighter blue (#2EA4A4). 

I added the storyline for each of the movies into the create_movie_tiles_content function and in the movie_tile_content variable in fresh_tomatoes.py. This allowed for the brief movie synopsis to show up on the website below each respective movie title.
