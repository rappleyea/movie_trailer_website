Extra Credit Description
------------------------
CSS:
The background color of the body of the website was changed to a dark, grayish-blue (#207373). The tile color when the mouse is hovering over it was changed from white (#EEE) to a lighter blue (#2EA4A4).

CONTENT:
I added the storyline for each of the movies into the create_movie_tiles_content function and in the movie_tile_content variable in fresh_tomatoes.py; this allowed for the brief movie synopsis to show up on the website below each respective movie title. I also added the year the movie came out as a part of the movie_title variable.
